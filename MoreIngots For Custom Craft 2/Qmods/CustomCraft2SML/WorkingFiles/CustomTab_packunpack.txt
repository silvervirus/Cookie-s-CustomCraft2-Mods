# These are samples for adding your own custom crafting tab nodes to the game's existing fabricators. #
# After you add new tabs here, you can use them to better organize your AddedRecipes. #
# If you want to add your new tab inside an existing one, you will need internal name of that tab. #
# You can find all the internal names of all tabs to all fabricators in the README file. #

# The Custom Tabs update comes with some new additions to what you can do with EasyMarkup, so pay close attention to the samples here. #
